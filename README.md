# JavaScript Training Project
A quick JavaScript Training Project I have drawn up. 

## Goal
Once completed this project will allow you to pull a list of names from a JSON source (normally an API service somewhere) and order them alphabetically. Then using Javascript create 10 drop down boxes in a form containing a list of the names. 

## What will be used/tested
* JavaScript Arrays
* For Loops
* While Loops
* Javascript functions
* Adding content to a webpage (innerHTML)
* Very basic overview of ajax

## What is provided?
* A template HTML page, using Bootstrap to provide a place to test the code
* A JSON file on the internet to retrieve (www.nutbolt.eu/other/names.json)
* The code required to retrieve the JSON file and parse it into a Javascript array (as out of scope of the project)
