# JavaScript Training Project
A quick JavaScript Training Project I have drawn up, mainly covering loops. 

## Goal
Once completed you will be able to order an array of strings alphabetically and use a user defined value from a webpage to create a defined number of dropdown boxes in a form, each containing a list of the names. 

## What will be used/tested
* JavaScript variables, including arrays
* For loops
* While loops
* Javascript functions
* Reading/Adding content from/to a webpage
* Basic jQuery & Bootstrap

## What is provided?
* A template HTML page, including the form element for a user to define the number of dropdown boxes they require
* An array of names to use
