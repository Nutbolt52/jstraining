# JavaScript Training Project
A quick JavaScript Training Project I have drawn up, mainly covering loops. 

## Goal
Once completed you will be able to pull a list of names from a JSON source (normally an external API service) and order them alphabetically. 

Then, using a user defined value from the webpage, create a defined number of drop down boxes in a form, each containing a list of the names. 

## What will be used/tested
* JavaScript variables, including arrays
* For loops
* While loops
* Javascript functions
* Reading/Adding content from/to a webpage
* Basic ajax, jQuery & Bootstrap

## What is provided?
* A template HTML page, including the form element for a user to define the number of drop down boxes they require
* A JSON file on the internet to retrieve (www.nutbolt.eu/other/names.json)
* The code required to retrieve the JSON file and parse it into a Javascript array (as out of scope of the project)
